Operating System Lab Codes
This repository contains the lab codes for the Operating System course. Each folder in the repository represents a specific lab exercise and contains the corresponding code files.

Lab Exercises
Producer-Consumer Problem: Solves the classic producer-consumer problem using mutex and semaphores. The solution demonstrates synchronization between multiple producers and consumers.

First Readers-Writers Problem: Provides a solution for the first readers-writers problem using mutex and semaphore. The solution handles concurrent read and write access to a shared resource.

Memory Allocation Algorithms: Implements various memory allocation algorithms, including Best Fit, First Fit, and Worst Fit. The codes simulate the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks for different processes.

Page Replacement Algorithms: Implements page replacement algorithms, including Optimal Page Replacement (OPR). The codes simulate the page reference and replacement process, tracking the number of page faults and hits.

Usage
Each lab exercise folder contains the source code files and a README file with detailed instructions and explanations. To run the code, follow the instructions provided in the corresponding README file.
